If you try without installing them, the face of the metahuman character will not appear

These are the files:

You need to put "Character1_FaceMesh" file to "Your project path"\Content\Metahumans\Character1\Face and

After importing the zip files to your computer and dropping the 2 files in the specified locations, you can start using your own metahuman characters with "MH_CharacterBP"
